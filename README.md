# CMD Themes
This is a collection of color themes for `cmd.exe` of Microsoft Windows, inspired by [this solarized theme](https://github.com/neilpa/cmd-colors-solarized). It consists of simulations of some well-known color themes in different terminals and dev environments.

Instead of importing Registry entries, I decide to show the configuration in images, to: 
 - show "how-to" in a user level, to accomodate needs of everyone who may want to adapt it without any knowledge about Registry Editor;
 - change the default color table of `cmd.exe` as little as possible, because what need to be changed are only 4 colores.
 
The environments/editors that serves me as example of imitation are: 
 - Ubuntu terminal (purple background + white font)
 - Turbo Pascal environment (dark blue background + yellow font)
 - Legacy computers' terminal, like those of IBM in the later 80s' of last century (black background + green font).
 
Transparency is added for aesthetic reason. I also found that it increases readability. 

Change color settings in "Properties" to change for current windows, and in "Default values" for all subsequent sessions.
